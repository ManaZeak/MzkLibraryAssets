  "bio": "Kirk Lee Hammett is an American musician who has been the lead guitarist and a contributing songwriter for heavy metal band Metallica since 1983. Before joining Metallica he formed and named the band Exodus. In 2003, Hammett was ranked 11th on Rolling Stone's list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. In 2009, Hammett was ranked number 15 in Joel McIver's book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists.\n\nIn 1983, Hammett received a phone call from Metallica on April 1, and flew out to New York for an audition on April 11, the same day Mustaine was let go. Vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield said: \"The first song we played was \"Seek and Destroy\", and Kirk pulled off this solo, and it was like ... things are going to be alright!\" Hammett was instantly asked to join the band.\n\nHammett has written a number of riffs for Metallica since Ride the Lightning. One of his riffs was used on \"Enter Sandman\" - which went on to become one of Metallica's most popular songs. It was the first track and the first single on the band's self-titled album Metallica.",
