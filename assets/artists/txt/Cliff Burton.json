He also received a posthumous writing credit for the song \"To Live Is to Die\" from the band's fourth studio album, ...And Justice for All.\n\nOn September 27, 1986, around 7:00 a.m. Burton died in a bus crash in Kronoberg County, a rural area of southern Sweden, as Metallica toured in support of the Master of Puppets album.
